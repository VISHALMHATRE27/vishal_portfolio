      <description>The Cricket Prediction Model was tested with 3 different algorithms i.e the Random Forest ,Support Vector Machine and the Logistic Regression. It was observed that the Random Forest Algorithm worked with a good accuracy. This project tends to show how Machine Learning could be used to calculate probabilities in a Cricket match. With more amount of genuine data set we can increase the accuracy of the model. Finally I deployed the machine learning model on a website using Flask, Html and CSS.</description>
