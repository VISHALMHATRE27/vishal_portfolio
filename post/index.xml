      <description>The stock price data represents a financial time series data which becomes more difficult to predict due to its characteristics and dynamic nature. In this project my aim was to predict the future value of the financial stocks of a company. In this model I used LSTMs which are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because theyâ€™re able to store past information. This is important because the previous price of a stock is crucial in predicting its future price.</description>

      <title>Cricket Prediction using Machine Learning</title>

      <description>The Cricket Prediction Model was tested with 3 different algorithms i.e the Random Forest ,Support Vector Machine and the Logistic Regression. It was observed that the Random Forest Algorithm worked with a good accuracy. This project tends to show how Machine Learning could be used to calculate probabilities in a Cricket match. With more amount of genuine data set we can increase the accuracy of the model. Finally I deployed the machine learning model on a website using Flask, Html and CSS.</description>
